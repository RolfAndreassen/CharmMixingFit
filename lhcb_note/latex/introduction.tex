\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
To fully understand the global impact of the updated WS $D^0\to K\pi$ analysis, 
a combination of global results of the neutral $D$ system is necessary. We present
an HFAG-like fit for the underlying parameters $|q/p|$, $\phi$, $x$ and $y$, combining
the updated 2011+2012 LHCb $D^0\to K\pi$ results with older results from HFAG. We find that the LHCb measurement,
with its small difference between plus-superscript and minus-superscript values,
is a powerful constraint on the value of $|q/p|$. In the case of no direct CP violation,
the error drops from the current HFAG average of about 7\% down to a mere 1.3\%. 
It is less powerful in constraining $x$ and $y$.

For this study we do three kinds of fits: ``Type 1'', where we assume no CP violation,
``Type 2'' where only indirect CP violation is allowed, and ``Type 3'' where all the
CP-violating parameters are allowed to float independently. In each case, we study
how the fit results, and especially the $\chi^2$, change in response to considering
subsets of the possible inputs; we find that some measurements are very heavy contributors
to $\chi^2$, but removing them does not much change the fit results.

By utilizing a global, HFAG-like fit, we constrain to be $|q/p| = xxxxx\pm yyyyy$ 
and $\phi = zzzzzzz\pm qqqqqqqqqqqqq$, 
in the case of all CPV allowed. Allowing only direct CPV, $|q/p| = xxxxx\pm yyyyy$
and $\phi = zzzzzzz\pm qqqqqqqqqqqqq$.
These measurements represent the most precise determination of the CP violating
parameters of the netural $D$ meson system

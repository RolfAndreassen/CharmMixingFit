\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
By utilizing an HFAG like fit to global results for the neutral $D$ meson system,
we find that including the latest LHCb data increases the precision of the parameter 
$|q/p|$ to $\mathcal{O}(1.3\%)$ in the case of no direct CP violation, and to $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$
 in the case of all CP violation allowed. We verify of our fit procedure by fitting for 
the parameters reported by the HFAG collaboration using data available as of April 2013. 
These measurements represent the most precise determination of the CP violating
parameters of the netural $D$ meson system.

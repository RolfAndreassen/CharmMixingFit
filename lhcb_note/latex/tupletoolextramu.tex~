\section{TupleToolExtraMu}
\label{sec:TupleToolExtraMu}
Looking explicitly for extra particles in the decay and asking whether or not these particles would satisfy the selection criteria for a given channel is done automatically by the DecayTreeTuple algorithm. However, it is beneficial to ask whether there are other particles which would satisfy the same selection criteria. The motivation behind writing the tool TupleToolExtraMu was to explicitly search for extra muons in an event which could be confused with, or be mis-associated as the true muon from the semileptonic decay $B\to \mu D^* X$. Storing additonal information about the ``extra" candidate then allows for a by-hand analysis of extra candidates.\\
TupleToolExtraMu configures as a tuple tool added to the DecayTreeTuple algorithm. By default, it outputs
\begin{itemize}
	\item The number of additional muons reconstructed from the TES location StdAllVeryLooseMuons, called extra muons
	\item The 4-momentum components of the extra muons
	\item The charge of the extra muon
	\item The Delta Log Likelihood distributions $\Delta \log( \mathcal{L}(\mu-\pi))$ and  $\Delta \log( \mathcal{L}(\mu-K))$ for the extra muon
	\item The Ghost Probability of the extra muon
	\item The extra muon Track Ghost Probability
	\item Extra muon Track $\chi^2/DoF$
	\item The invariant mass of the extra muon and the original muon being used
	\item The vertex $\chi^2$ and $DoF$ of the extra muon and original muon vertex
	\item The vertex $\chi^2$ and $DoF$ of the extra muon and the $D^*$ candidate
	\item The invariant mass of the extra muon and $D^*$ candidates
	\item The IP and IP$\chi^2$ of the extra muon
	\item Whether or not the extra muon originates from the same primary vertex as the $D^*$ candidate
\end{itemize}
This information allows one to, by hand, apply the stripping selections to the extra muons. The inclusion of the invariant mass distributions is meant to provide a tool in searching for additional sources of background. Figure~\ref{fig:nextra} shows the output of the number of extra muons summed over all events. Na\"ively, Poisson statistics are expected. The additional lines show the transformation of the number of additional candidate muons after applying cuts.

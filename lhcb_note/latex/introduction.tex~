\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
\hspace{10mm}The doubly-tagged decay $B\to\mu D^* X,D^*\to D^0\pi_S,D^0\to K \pi$ 
provides the opportunity to add statistics to the lowest decay time bins to the 
prompt analysis $D^*\to D^0\pi_S,D^0\to K \pi$ Which validates mixing of the neutral
D meson system at more than 9$\sigma$. Double tagging the sample with the $\mu$ and $\pi_S$ allows for 
the extraction of an extremely pure sample of $D^*\to D^0\pi_S,D^0\to K \pi$, with 
the majority of the statistics falling in the lowest decay time bins. However, 
utilization of this decay incorporates systematic uncertainties not present in the 
prompt analysis, specifically associated with the $\mu$. By looking for additonal muons which 
also satisfy the selection criteria and exploring the additional properties associated with them,
it is possible to numerically analyze the contribution of misidentification and misassociation, which allows
for a data driven method for extracting the possible backgrounds. 
Exploration of these possibilities motivates the writing of the tool TupleToolExtraMu. In
Section~\ref{sec:TupleToolExtraMu}, 
the method of implementation of the tool is described. Section~\ref{sec:Invariant-Mass-Plots} contains the 
invariant mass plots of this extra candidate. Section~\ref{sec:Monte-Carlo} compares the results with Monte 
Carlo Simulation.

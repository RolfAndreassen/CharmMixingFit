\section{Measurements Used}
\label{sec:measurements}

As input for the fit method, all results from many different experiments have been compiled. 
Table~\ref{table:nocpv_inputs} lists all the possible
measurements pertaining to fits excluding CP Violation. Table~\ref{table:nodcpv_inputs}
corresponds to measurements allowing only direct CP violation, and 
Table~\ref{table:allcpv_inputs} lists all measurments pertaining to both
direct and indirect CP violation allowed. As a starting point, all measurements are used
in the fit. However, the BaBar $K\pi$ results add a large $\chi^2$ value to the fit. By systematically
removing measurements from the total fit, we study the effect on the total $\chi^2$ of the fit.\\

Additionally, as the LHCb $A_\Gamma$ results are not yet published, we choose to do sets of fits both
including and excluding this result.

\section{Measurements Used}
\label{sec:measurements}

Of all of the current measurements available, only a few are resonable
for certain fits. Table~\ref{table:nocpv_inputs} lists all the possible
 measurements pertaining to fits excluding CP Violation. Table~\ref{blah}
corresponds to measurements allowing only direct CP violation, and 
Table~\ref{table:all_cpv_meas} lists all measurments pertaining to both
direct and indirect CP violation allowed.

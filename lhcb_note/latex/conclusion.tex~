The tool TupleToolExtraMu allows a way to explore the backgrounds contributing 
to the decay $B\to \mu D^* X, D^*\to D^0\pi_S,D^0\to K\pi$ due to misidentification or 
mis-association of muons in the event. It has proven to be a very useful data-driven 
tool which allowed identification of backgrounds as well as determination of background 
shapes. While agreement with Monte Carlo is only partial, the usefulness in exploring 
the LHCb data via data-driven methods is easily seen.
